# kanva.js

kanva.js is a lightweight JavaScript game engine. during a game jam, me and a friend developed a game that sparked the idea of reusing some of our code to create a game engine for future game jams.

having used JavaScript almost every day in the past, I realized that I should have thought of creating a reusable game engine earlier, especially since I've implemented game engines in more complex settings before. kanva.js aims to simplify the game development process for enthusiasts and developers alike, allowing for rapid prototyping and iteration during game jams.
